# CMF251-GameDEV
This is the open repository for CMF251 game models. Only add model and supporting files here.

## How to use for basic members:
Github is an application which will allow us to organize and control our update files when developing our major project this semester.
A basic tutorial can be found on Github's website [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
